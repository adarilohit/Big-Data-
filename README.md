A non-profit animal organization is to create a comprehensive, data-driven platform that connects animal welfare organizations, veterinary clinics, and pet owners to create a more efficient and effective animal welfare system. The Portage APL maintains all animal data, like vaccinations, diseases, and tags. It helps to keep a record of animal welfare and the responsibility of pet ownership.
For a non-profit organization, sponsors make a major contribution. As the dataset consists of a Program column, the more the programs are, the better we can attract sponsors. The organization could also offer sponsors branded merchandise or other promotional materials, further increasing their engagement and investment in the organization's mission.
